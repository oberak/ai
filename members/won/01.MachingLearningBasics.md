## Summary

### Machine Learning
- Limitations of explicit programming
  - Spam filter: many rules
  - Automatic driving: too many rules
- Machine learning: `Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed` Arthur Samuel (1959)

### Supervised/Unsupervised learning
- Supervised learning:
  - learning with labeled examples - training set
  - Most common problem type in ML
  - Examples
    + Image labeling: learning from tagged images
    + Email spam filter: learning from labeled (spam or ham) email
    + Predicting exam score: learning from previous exam score and time spent

- Unsupervised learning
  - un-labeled data
  - ex) Google news grouping, Word clustering

- Types of supervised learning
  - Regression: Predicting final exam score based on time spent
  - Classification
    + binary classification: Pass/non-pass based on time spent
    + multi-label classification: Letter grade (A, B, C, E and F) based on time spent
